# UTkarsh's dotfiles

Contains dotfiles for vim and zsh. Not very awesome like other dotfiles on
github but a short and sweet one for a noob like me.


# Prerequisites

### zsh
This assumes that you have zsh with antigen installed.
For ubuntu you can use:
```
sudo apt-get install zsh
sudo apt-get install zsh-antigen
```

### vim
This assumes that you have vundle installed.


# How to use

Follow these steps:

```
cd ~
mkdir bin
cd bin
git clone https://github.com/UtkarshMe/dotfiles
link ~/bin/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
link ~/bin/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
