# UTkarsh's dotfiles

Contains dotfiles for vim and zsh. Not too awesome like some other dotfiles
on github but a short and sweet one for a noob like me.

## Prerequisites

- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se)
- [zsh](http://www.zsh.org)
- [vim](http://www.vim.org)
- [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen#installation)

For Ubuntu (or debian based systems) use:
```
sudo apt-get install git-all curl zsh vim
```

## How to install

git clone https://github.com/UtkarshMe/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
